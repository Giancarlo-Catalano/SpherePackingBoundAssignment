# Sphere packing bound
This code generates a table that relates to sphere packing bounds.
If I want a reliability of "only wrong once in a million" through a transmission channel with error rate 1%, and I want to represent M possible symbols, what is the lower bound of bits necessary to safely represent the message?


The code is incredibly inefficient, but it's readable enough.
